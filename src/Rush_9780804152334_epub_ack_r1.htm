<p class="nonindent">Six of these stories have been published previously, although in somewhat different form. They first appeared in the following places:</p>
<p class="indent">‘Good Advice Is Rarer Than Rubies’ in the <em>New Yorker</em>; ‘The Free Radio’ in <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>; ‘The Prophet’s Hair’ in <em>London Review of Books</em>; ‘Yorick’ in <em>Encounter</em>; ‘At the Auction of the Ruby Slippers’ in <em>Granta</em>; and ‘Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella of Spain’ in the <em>New Yorker.</em></p>
<p class="indent">‘The Harmony of the Spheres’, ‘Chekov and Zulu’ and ‘The Courter’ have not been published before.</p>
<p class="indent">‘The Harmony of the Spheres’ relies, for some of its occultist material, on the writings of James Webb, especially <em>The Occult Underground</em> (Open Court, Illinois, 1974) and <em>The Harmonious Circle</em> (Putnam, 1980).</p>
<p class="indent">In ‘The Courter’, the author wishes to thank Hal Leonard Music Corporation for permission to reproduce ‘Sherry’, words and music by Bob Gaudio, copyright © 1962, 1963 (renewed) by the Claridge Music Company, a division of MPL Communications, Inc. All rights reserved. Reprinted by permission of Hal Leonard Music Corporation.</p>
<p class="indent">The passage quoted on <a class="hlink" href="Rush_9780804152334_epub_c09_r1.htm#page194">this page</a> is in fact an account of a game between S. Reshevsky and M. Najdorf, played in 1957 and described in <em>The Most Instructive Games of Chess Ever Played</em>, by Irving Chernev (Faber and Faber, 1966).</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, thanks to Bill Buford, Susannah Clapp and Bob Gottlieb; Sonny Mehta and Erroll McDonald; and Frances Coady and Caroline Michel.</p>
