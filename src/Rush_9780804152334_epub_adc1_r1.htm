<p class="center" style="line-height:1.5em;">THE MOOR’S LAST SIGH<br/><em>A Novel</em></p>
<p class="nonindent">With <em>The Moor’s Last Sigh</em>, Salman Rushdie gives the reader a masterpiece of breathtaking scope and ambition, surpassing even the spectacular imaginative brilliance of his now-classic <em>Midnight’s Children.</em> The Moor’s story evokes his family’s often grotesque but compulsively moving fortunes and the lost world of possibilities embodied by India in this century. His is a tale of premature deaths and family rifts; of thwarted loves and money; and the even more morally dubious seductions and mysteries of art. By turns compassionate, wicked, poignant, and funny, this brilliant work is a stunningly conceived and gracefully realized treasure by one of the masters of modern fiction.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
